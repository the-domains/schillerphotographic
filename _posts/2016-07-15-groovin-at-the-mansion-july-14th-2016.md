  Live music is always a treat. The energy and atmosphere is something that
  simply cannot be captured on a digital file. I recently purchased a new lens,
  the Petzval 58, and I was dying to use it. The lens was perfect for showcasing
  the groove and funk these bands brought to their performances.

Live music is always a treat. The energy and atmosphere is something that simply cannot be captured on a digital file. I recently purchased a new lens, the Petzval 58, and I was dying to use it. The lens was perfect for showcasing the groove and funk these bands brought to their performances.

The Headliners were Three Thousand Dollar Carpets with Cole on guitar/vocals, Harry on guitar, Jody on drums, and Nik on bass. Their song, "Ships in the Night" was one of my favourites.

The show was opened by one of my favourite local bands, Shushlang! They are the masters of groove and funk. They just released a new EP that you should definitely check out. It's available on their bandcamp.

Performing after Shushlang was a Toronto-based band called Talking Out Loud! They were high-energy and had an angst that was pleasantly nostalgic of the early 2000's.
